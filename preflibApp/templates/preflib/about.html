<h1>About</h1>

<p> PrefLib is a reference library of preference data and links assembled by <a href="http://www.nickmattei.net">Nicholas Mattei</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/">Toby Walsh</a> and lately <a href="http://simonrey.fr">Simon Rey</a>. This site and library is proudly supported by the <a href="https://research.csiro.au/adt/">Algorithmic Decision Theory group</a> at <a href="https://www.data61.csiro.au/">Data61</a>.</p>

<p>We want to provide a comprehensive resource for the multiple research communities that deal with preferences, including computational social choice, recommender systems, data mining, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization, to name just a few. </p>

<h2> Citation Policy </h2>

<p>We ask that you provide a reference to our repository when publishing research based on data gathered here as this will allow other researchers to find us. Additionally, some of our datasets have citation policies specific to them, please comply with these requests. Many hours have been spent to gather, organize, and publish these datasets and we want to provide credit where credit is due.</p>
